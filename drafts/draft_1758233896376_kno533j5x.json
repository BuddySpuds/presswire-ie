    "summary": "Autumn Garden Preparation Guide 2025 for Ireland: A Month-by-Month Practical Checklist\nAs autumn 2025 approaches in Ireland, gardeners face unique challenges shaped by rising input costs, labour shortages, and increasingly unpredictable weather patterns. This comprehensive guide offers a detailed, month-by-month plan to help you prepare your garden efficiently and sustainably. Emphasising soil health through peat-free organic composts, climate-resilient plants, and labour-saving maintenance techniques, this resource is tailored for Irish homeowners and gardening enthusiasts aiming to optimise their outdoor spaces for the autumn and winter seasons.",
    "body": "Horticultural input prices in Ireland have risen by over 50% since 2021, with labour accounting for 42.6% of costs, making cost-effective, labour-saving gardening methods essential.\nFor your food growing needs and container gardening consider Incorporating peat-free organic composts such as Organic Compost 80L - Peat Free Vegetable & Salad Growing Mix (€21.95) and Irish Organic Worm Compost 80L (€21.95) to sustainably improve soil fertility and structure.\nClimate-resilient plants like Hedera Helix Ivy and Climbing Hydrangea Petiolaris provide year-round coverage, reducing maintenance and protecting your garden from harsh weather.\nEarly autumn is ideal for sowing green manures and applying organic mulches at least 3 inches deep to conserve moisture and suppress weeds effectively.\nSeasonal maintenance tasks such as mulching, lawn care (aeration, scarifying, feeding), deadheading, and dividing perennials will rejuvenate your garden and reduce spring workload.\nAdopting eco-friendly practices and selecting labour-saving plants can reduce chemical inputs and alleviate labour constraints.",
