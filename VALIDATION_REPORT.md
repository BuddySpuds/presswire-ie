## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. **Domain Verification API**
**Issue:** MX record checking fails for test domains
**Impact:** Cannot verify email domains in development
**Solution Applied:** Added development mode bypass for .ie domains
**Status:** Partially fixed for development

### 2. **Missing npm Dependencies**
**Issue:** Some API functions may need additional packages
**Required Action:** None - core dependencies are installed
**Note:** node-fetch v2.7.0 working correctly

### 3. **Environment Variables**
**Issue:** No .env file present
**Impact:** API keys not configured
**Required Action:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with actual API keys
```

### 4. **PR Generation API**
**Issue:** Requires OpenRouter API key for AI generation
**Impact:** Cannot generate AI-enhanced content without key
**Required Action:** Sign up at openrouter.ai and add key to .env
