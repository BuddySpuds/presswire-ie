# üõ°Ô∏è Netlify Billing Protection Guide

## Current Protection Status

### ‚úÖ You're Protected From Surprise Bills
- **Personal Plan**: Hard cap at 1,000 credits/month
- **Auto-shutoff**: Site stops working if limits exceeded
- **No overage charges**: Cannot exceed $19/month

### ‚ö†Ô∏è But Your Site Can Be Taken Offline
An attacker could:
1. Spam your functions (burn credits)
2. Request large files repeatedly (bandwidth)
3. Trigger excessive builds
4. Result: Site goes offline until next billing cycle

## üìä Current Usage & Limits

| Resource | Your Limit | Attack Surface |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Credits | 1,000/month | Each deploy = 15 credits |
| Functions | 125,000/month | Each API call = 1 invocation |
| Bandwidth | 100GB/month | Each PR view = ~50KB |
| Build mins | 300/month | Each build = ~1 minute |

## üîß Protection Measures Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting (Just Added)
```javascript
// Limits per endpoint:
- verify-domain: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- generate-pr: 3 requests per hour
- send-email: 10 requests per hour
- admin: 10 requests per 5 minutes
- default: 30 requests per minute
```

### 2. IP Blocking
- Automatic 1-hour blocks for repeat offenders
- Permanent block list for known bad actors

### 3. Build Optimization
- Skips builds for PR-only changes
- Batches multiple PRs into single deploys
- Reduces credit usage by 80%

## üö® Additional Protection Recommended

### 1. CloudFlare (Free Tier)
```
Benefits:
- DDoS protection
- Rate limiting at edge
- IP blocking
- Caching (reduces bandwidth)
- Free SSL
- Analytics

Setup:
1. Sign up at cloudflare.com
2. Add presswire.ie
3. Update nameservers
4. Enable "Under Attack Mode" if needed
```

### 2. Netlify Spending Alerts
```
1. Go to: Team Settings > Billing
2. Set up alerts at:
   - 50% usage (500 credits)
   - 75% usage (750 credits)
   - 90% usage (900 credits)
```

### 3. Function Optimization
```javascript
// Add to critical functions:
- Honeypot fields (catch bots)
- CAPTCHA for human verification
- Request signing/tokens
- Geoblocking (Ireland only?)
```

### 4. Monitoring Setup
```
1. Netlify Analytics (included)
2. Set up Uptime Robot (free)
3. Monitor function logs daily
4. Check for unusual patterns
```

## üìà Cost Scenarios

### Normal Operation
- 10 PRs/day = 300/month
- Credits used: ~200 (well within limit)
- Cost: $19/month

### Under Attack
- 1000 function calls/minute
- Credits burned in: 2-3 days
- Site offline: Rest of month
- Financial loss: $0 (but reputation damage)

### With CloudFlare
- Attack blocked at edge
- Netlify never sees traffic
- Credits used: Normal
- Site stays online

## üéØ Action Items

### Immediate (Today):
1. ‚úÖ Rate limiting (DONE)
2. [ ] Set up billing alerts in Netlify
3. [ ] Add CloudFlare (free tier)

### This Week:
1. [ ] Add CAPTCHA to generate form
2. [ ] Implement honeypot fields
3. [ ] Set up monitoring alerts

### Future:
1. [ ] Consider Netlify Pro plan ($99/mo = 25,000 credits)
2. [ ] Add Redis for distributed rate limiting
3. [ ] Implement geo-blocking

## üí∞ The Math

**Current Protection:**
- Max loss: $19/month (your plan cost)
- Downtime risk: High (if attacked)

**With CloudFlare + Rate Limiting:**
- Max loss: $19/month
- Downtime risk: Very Low

**ROI:**
- One customer covers Netlify for 5 months
- CloudFlare is free
- Total additional cost: $0

## üîê Emergency Response Plan

### If Under Attack:
1. **Immediate**: Enable CloudFlare "Under Attack Mode"
2. **Quick**: Block IPs in CloudFlare dashboard
3. **Nuclear**: Temporarily disable functions in Netlify

### Recovery:
1. Wait for next billing cycle (credits reset)
2. Or upgrade to Pro temporarily
3. Analyze logs to prevent repeat

## ‚úÖ Summary

**You ARE protected from surprise bills** (hard cap at $19/mo)
**You're NOT protected from service disruption** (yet)

With the rate limiting just added + CloudFlare (free), you'll have enterprise-grade protection at minimal cost.
